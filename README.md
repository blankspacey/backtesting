# Usage

You can gather data from Yahoo Finance but I chose to use a local excel file since Yahoo Finance does not offer data on Italian futures for some reason.

The strategy consists in using the MACD, RSI and CCI to determine if there's momentum for a quick trade. It's not really that profitable and doesn't maximise profits but it survived all of the worst events that occured in the last 20 years. I need to work on that aspect before actually deploying such strategy.
